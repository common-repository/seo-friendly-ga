== Installation ==

**Installation**

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Cryptothanks, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click “Add New”.
In the search field type “cryptothanks” and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

MANUAL INSTALLATION
The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here: https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation 

UPDATING
Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

**Usage**

To enable Google Analytics tracking on your site, follow these steps:

1. Visit the "Plugin Settings" panel
2. Enter your GA Tracking ID
3. Choose either [Universal Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/) or [Global Site Tag](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/)
4. Configure any other plugin settings as desired (optional)

Save changes and done. After 24-48 hours, you can log into your Google Analytics account to view your stats.

Note that it can take 24-48 hours after adding the tracking code before any analytical data appears in your [Google Analytics account](https://developers.google.com/analytics/). To check that the GA tacking code is included, look at the source code of your web page(s). Learn more at the [Google Analytics Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906).
